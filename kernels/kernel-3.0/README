    vmlinux-3.0.px	Kernel image for Series 1 TiVo running version
			3.0-* of the TiVo software.

    config-3.0		Kernel config file for vmlinux-3.0.px.

Changes to the stock TiVo Linux sources:
  o LBA48 (actually LBA32) support in the IDE driver.  This means
    that drives larger than 128GiB (137GB) are now supported.
    NOTE: to access the full capacity of a large disk you must
	  run MFS Tools under a version of Linux that has LBA48
	  support.  Otherwise, you will only be able to use up to
	  128GiB (137GB) of the disk.
	 
  o Large swap partition support.  The stock TiVo Linux kernel is
    only capable of using the first 128MiB of a swap partition.
    This diff adds support for version 1 swap partitions.  NOTE
    that you will need to write a version 1 swap header to support
    a large partition.  You can use my tpip utility for this or,
    you can run my updated mkswap binary on the TiVo itself with
    the "-v1" flag.  Both are available in my main TiVo directory.
    You cannot simply run mkswap on an x86 PC running Linux due
    to byte order differences (even with byte swapping turned on)
    unless you use my patch to mkswap that adds a byte swapping
    option; see mkswap.diff in my main TiVo directory.

 o  It is now possible to use the DSS port as the system console,
    allowing you to see the boot and kernel messages.  To enable
    this, set "dsscon=true" in the boot parameters, just like
    you would on a Series 2 TiVo.

 o  The kernel does not include a driver for a PC IDE controller
    since the TiVo doesn't include one (it has a custom IDE
    controller).  This saves a bit of space.

 o  The __kernel_thread symbol is exported so you can build NFS
    as a module.

The patches to the stock TiVo Linux sources are available from:

Installing the new kernel:

The simplest way by far is to use tpip, http://www.courtesan.com/tivo/tpip.html
