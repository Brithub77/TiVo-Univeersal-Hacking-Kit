*** HackD v1.2 by Brithub77 ***
*** Everything you need in order to get your Series3 TiVo HackD ***

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR BREAK YOUR TIVO.
_____________________________________________________________________________

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

1. Take the drive out of the TiVo and attach it to your computer.

2. Run "HackD". It will automate the hacking process so that you won't have to do it yourself.

3. Run patch scripts if you'd like.

4. That's it! Put the drive back in the TiVo and see if it boots up.
