PLEASE READ THIS SHORT FILE THOROUGHLY.  REALLY.

This tool is mostly untested, and comes with no warranty whatsoever.

It will probably cause your tivo to burst into flames, so don't blame me if 
you run this anyway and it does.

If you remain undeterred, and would like to run this program, usage is below.

This program creates backups of season pass, wishlist and logo assignment 
information on your tivo.

To create a backup, do:

	backup > outfile

this will create a file "outfile" containing the backup data.  you can 
compress and store this, or copy it over to another tivo for restore, or
whatever you like.  The outfile is in plain text.

To use a backup, do:

	restore infile

"restore" will read the data in infile, and create the season passes, wishlists
and logo assignments.  IT DOES NOT DELETE EXISTING SEASON PASSES AND WISHLISTS.
If you want to exactly replicate the tivo that the backup came from, you 
should manually delete the existing season passes and wishlists on the target
machine.  If you do a backup and then a restore, you will end up with 2 of
everything.  Consider yourself warned.

This program is very much untested, so I am interested in hearing any test
results people have.  if you get an error, please include the full text of
the error message in your report.  I can be reached at user name angra on the
tivo community forum, or via email at danspam@envy.gtf.org
