*** HackD v1.3 by Brithub77 ***
*** Everything you need in order to get your Series3 TiVo HackD ***

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR BREAK YOUR TIVO.
_____________________________________________________________________________

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

1. Take the drive out of the TiVo and attach it to your computer.
2. Run "HackD". It will automate the hacking process so that you won't have to do it yourself.
3. Run patch scripts if you'd like.
4. That's it! Put the drive back in the TiVo and see if it boots up.

     are explained later in the README)

     can be located
  -> source_video -- where streams from hacked TiVos can conveniently be stored
     (rename it to whatever you'd like)
  -> tivoapp_patches -- software-specific patches for US tivoapps to enable 
     backdoors, disable encryption, etc.
  -> bootpage -- sets boot parameters to TiVo (e.g. enabling hacks such as Telnet,
     prevention of software upgrades, etc.)
  -> hack_AU.tar.gz -- busybox distro complete with all the necessary 
     hacks and utilities for AU/NZ TiVos

     hacks and utilities for US TiVos
  -> get-password.sh -- the script in which you choose your own username and 
     password for logging in to the SSH server
  -> hack_oztivoapp_PC -- patches AU/NZ tivoapps only while the drive is attached 
     to the PC
  -> hack_oztivoapp_TiVo -- natively patches AU/NZ tivoapps

     the PC

     the drive is attached to the PC
  -> hack_tivoapp_PC_11.0n.H1 -- patches US tivoapps for version 11.0n.H1 only while
     the drive is attached to the PC
  -> hack_tivoapp_PC_11.0n.K1 -- patches US tivoapps for version 11.0n.K1 only while
     the drive is attached to the PC
  -> hack_tivoapp_TiVo -- natively patches US tivoapps
  -> hack_tivoapp_TiVo_9.3.Y3 -- natively patches US tivoapps for version 9.3.Y3
  -> hack_tivoapp_TiVo_11.0n.H1 -- natively patches US tivoapps for version 11.0n.H1
  -> hack_tivoapp_TiVo_11.0n.K1 -- natively patches US tivoapps for version 11.0n.K1
  -> HackD -- main script; does all of the hard work for you
  -> mfsftp.tar.gz -- archive containing MFS_FTP, a TiVo-native software used to extract 
     and transfer .ty, .ty+, or .tmf streams from MFS (TiVo's Media File System), as well 
     as retrive the .xml files that include the streams' metadata
  -> mfstools.tar.gz -- archive containing MFSTools programs (restore, backup, mfsck, mls, 
     etc.) for modifying TiVo drives; does NOT hack or extract anything on a drive
  -> mfs-utils64.tar.gz -- archive containing MFS-Utils programs for both 64-bit and 32-bit
     drive architecture (mfs_uberexport, mfs_streams, mfs_import, mfs_dumpobj, etc.); this is
     primarily used to extract recordings and modify the MFS database from where they are 
     stored
  -> null-linuxrc.img.gz -- backup of the initrd (internal ROM or memory) extracted 
     from a TiVo kernel using either of the replace_initrd binary programs (a short and 
     in-depth explanation of this is coming up very shortly in the README)
  -> pdisk -- utility that can perform tasks on your TiVo drive, such as listing its 
     partitions
  -> rc.sysinit.author -- startup script that allows all hacks to run once 
     MyWorld (TiVo's UI) is finished loading
  -> README -- this file
  -> replace_initrd_AU.x86 -- replaces the initrd in an AU/NZ TiVo kernel 
     and backs up the original initrd, as well as the kernel itself, to 
     allow the PROM to pass boot checks
  -> replace_initrd_US.x86 -- replaces the initrd in an US TiVo kernel and 
     backs up the original initrd, as well as the kernel itself, to allow 
     the PROM to pass boot checks
  -> tivo_apm_recognizer.patch -- patch file to be applied to your kernel's source directory
     (usually found in /usr/src); adds support for mounting TiVo drive partitions on your Linux
     distro; only tested and verified with newer Linux kernels on Ubuntu, so you might need to 
     manually edit the file to fit the version of your distro's kernel
  -> tivopart -- can revalidate the TiVo drive for Linux to be able to read, 
     as well as perform some other miscellaneous tasks; needed in order to mount 
     drive partitions, unless TiVo partition support is already built-in to your 
     Linux kernel (you need to patch and recompile the kernel in order
     for this to be possible; the patch file is included with HackD)
  -> tivowebplus.tgz -- archive containing the necessary installation files for
     TiVoWebPlus, a web server accessed from your TiVo's IP address
